          Codaru is an annual spring coding competition open to programmers of all ages
          and skill levelsâ€”from complete beginners to seasoned professionals. Held
          entirely online, the competition is designed to fit your schedule, with each
          challenge lasting a full week, allowing you to participate whenever it's
          convenient. You'll join one of six teams, working together with your teammates
          to take on challenges and compete against the others. Codaru's mission is to
